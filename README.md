# Flow-cytometry-panel-planner
[Lior Schori](https://schoril.github.io/) 


I will write a script that:
- Contains information on all the antibodies in our lab.
- Receives input on which proteins are planned to be labeled.
- Generates output indicating which fluorophore to use for each protein in the experiment based on the expression levels of the protein and fluorophore intensity
